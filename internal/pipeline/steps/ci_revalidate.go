// Revalidation of a head rewritten outside the run. While the CI monitor
// polls an open pull request, every observation of the branch head is checked
// against the set of heads this run owns: the recorded head, the durable
// last-pushed head, and the caller worktree's HEAD. A head the run owns
// nowhere means the branch was rewritten outside the run - typically a native
// stack rebase or a partial stack merge - and continuing to report checks for
// it would validate a commit the run never reviewed. The monitor then adopts
// the live head through the same durable path a CI repair uses and restarts
// the run at Review.

// maxAdoptionFetchAttempts bounds how often the adoption path re-reads and
// re-fetches the pull request branch while it keeps moving. Two attempts
// tolerate one move between observation and fetch; a branch still moving
// after that refuses rather than adopting a head nobody can name twice.
